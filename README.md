Xavius shoulders are not appearing correctly in wowhead inspector. Needed to manually add several xavius forms, though none of them on Zandalari Trolls. Might need to hop in game and get some screens.

Outfits are mostly screened from https://www.wowhead.com/outfits/race:31/gender:0#outfitgallery;680
